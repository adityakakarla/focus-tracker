Welcome to the Focus Tracker by Ganesh and Aditya!

Our project detects the presence of a phone in a webcam frame. If this occurs, a series of punishments is triggered: an annoying audio file is played on max volume, this github page is opened up, and a text will be sent to your phone telling you to "GET OFF OF YOUR PHONE" via Twilio.

Our model has been trained with the YOLOv5 model from Ultralytics. Using a photo collection script, we generated our own data by rapidly taking photos via our laptop's webcam.

This project has been deployed to the web via Roboflow: https://universe.roboflow.com/aditya-kakarla-wfuyi/photo-detector-v3
